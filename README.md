# Typography
This is a work in progress. The code needs a new structure, and the Letter class needs to be improved. 

For now, NewSymbols.pde allows to save sets of coordinates used as letter's skeleton. Then in DrawLetters.pde we can create typos and animate using the skeletons saved.

Some instructions for NewSymbols.pde : 
- Run the code
- Use left click to select new points. This points are going to be linked by lines as one part of the letter.
- Use right click to record a brake in the link and start a new section of the skeleton.

An Example with the Letter "A". it has: 
- Three points for it's triangle
- One brake
- Two points for the horizontal line
